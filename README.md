### Question 1

**Answer:** B. ReferenceError: greetign is not defined

**Explanation:**

The variable `greetign` is declared but never initialized. Therefore, when you try to access it, you will get a ReferenceError.

### Question 2

**Answer:** A. NaN

**Explanation:**

The `sum()` function adds two numbers together. However, when you try to add a number and a string, JavaScript will try to convert the string to a number. In this case, the string `"2"` will be converted to the number 2. Therefore, the result of the `sum()` function will be 3. However, the `console.log()` function will print the result as a string, so the output will be `"3"`.

### Question 3

**Answer:** A. ['üçï', 'üç´', 'ü•ë', 'üçî']

**Explanation:**

The `food` array is a constant, which means that its contents cannot be changed. Therefore, when you change the value of `info.favoriteFood`, the `food` array remains unchanged.

### Question 4

**Answer:** B. Hi there, undefined

**Explanation:**

The `sayHi()` function takes a name as a parameter, but when you call the function, you do not pass in a name. Therefore, the value of the `name` parameter will be `undefined`. When the function returns, it will return the string `Hi there, ${name}`, which will be evaluated to `Hi there, undefined`.

### Question 5

**Answer:** C. 3

**Explanation:**

The `forEach()` method iterates over the elements of an array and calls a callback function for each element. In this case, the callback function checks if the element is greater than zero. If it is, the `count` variable is incremented by one. Therefore, the value of the `count` variable after the `forEach()` method has finished iterating over the `nums` array will be 3.
